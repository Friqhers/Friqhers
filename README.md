## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an indie game developer with expertise in Unreal Engine and C++, with a focus on building games and applications using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and design patterns. Experienced in developing scalable and maintainable systems for projects of all sizes, I am eager to collaborate with other professionals who share the same passion for creating engaging and impactful gaming experiences.
